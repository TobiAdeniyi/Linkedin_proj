A word from us


Everybody likes to say they’re different...

Newton was founded to buck the norm in management consultancy - to demand better for its clients. Because, for us, change doesn’t come from behind a laptop. It comes from getting under the skin of an organisation and learning first-hand how it ticks. It’s not about producing reports that gather dust on a boardroom’s top shelf; it’s about delivering results that actually work.We crack some of the biggest challenges that businesses and public sector organisations face.

We’re called upon to bring much-needed change, from redesigning social care to improving build efficiencies on aircraft carriers. The work’s varied and complex - just how we like it. And no one else does it quite like we do. Take our business model. We guarantee our fees against delivering results, and will only leave once our clients see those results stick. Bold - yes. Disruptive? Always.

Blindingly fast career progression means that if you show you’re ready to step up - you’ll be promoted. Because we recognise talent, not tenure. And with all the support, training, and development you need, there’s really no stopping you. No matter the role you join in, you’ll be surrounded by spirited, naturally curious people. People who want to learn from you, and who’ll also teach you a thing or two along the way. It’s how everyone goes further, faster.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Applied Science based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

About Calligo

Data is any business’ most valuable asset. It should sit at the heart of every interaction they have and every decision they make – large or small.
But while data is essential for businesses to thrive, it is often also frustratingly invisible, inaccessible or irrelevant. And fraught with risk if it is lost, mismanaged or not surrounded by the right data privacy and security protections.
At Calligo, we understand that.
We understand that because of our heritage in data-driven business improvement, that gives us innate knowledge of industry regulations, national privacy laws, and ethical data use.
We understand that, and so have devised a unique collection of managed data services that transform how businesses use and perceive data to become faster, smarter and to use their data safer.
We understand that, shown in how we bring businesses closer to their data, and deliver the clarity they need to safely power profitability, agility and innovation.
At Calligo, we unleash the potential of your data.

Headquarters: London, UK

ProFinda is a software company pioneering “Workforce Optimisation”. This emerging £2.8bn software category will transform organisational productivity and the employee talent agenda. With our unique technology, our global clients and channel partnerships we are entering a massively exciting growth phase.

ProFinda is headquartered in London. Since going live in 2011, ProFinda has become an award-winning enterprise technology solution with a focus on professional services and other knowledge-driven industries.

These organisations have been spending millions on talent systems that haven’t given them the information they need about their own employee’s skills, let alone their total talent pool including contingent and alumni workers. As a result, employees are left unengaged and under-utilised while these organisations spend more money sourcing contingent workers to fill the gap, and not necessarily the right ones.

ProFinda is a workforce optimisation platform that maps the skills, knowledge, and expertise available across an organisation's total talent supply chain of internal, contingent and alumni workers.

By implementing ProFinda a company can now far better match their available talent internally and externally with the right opportunities at the right time, increasing engagement, productivity, and efficiency while decreasing costs. We use our proprietary skills ontology and machine learning to build an accurate knowledge base of the skills and experiences of employees, contractors, and alumni for major enterprises.

We believe we are changing the way companies think about their people and the way people think about their own careers, by making the total talent pool a reality. To take customers on this journey we need to win their confidence, excel at delivery and continually delight them as the product grows and changes. We treat each client like they were our first and want to find people who are as passionate as we are about client’s successes.

What we are looking for

We're looking for a Data Scientist with 5 or more years of demonstrable experience to work with our Intelligence team on building a semantic, local-grammar based system.

This is a full time role and we would expect the successful candidate to spend at least two days a week in the London Office with the option to work from home on the other days.

You will research and develop Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms, along with existing libraries usage and will be responsible for new ways of data usage discovery. You will also assist in product development, looking at things from a data perspective and be responsible for key textual data problems, suggestions and deep search.

Skills & Requirements:
An experience with advanced application architectures (5+ years)
Experience working with UniTex
Keen interest in cutting-edge ML/NLP solutions and technologies
Experience with Ruby, Python or Java will help but we can help you learn these if your experience in another language is good
Experience with AWS services

Senior Data Scientist

Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations.
About Agrimetrics
Mission

Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.

Products, services and customers

Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:
Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.

Funding

Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

[1] Along with our sister Agri-Tech Centres: Agri-EPI, CHAP and CIEL (www.agritechcentres.com)

Research Fellow (Data Scientist),£41K-£59K (Glassdoor Est.),"There are two posts available, both full time working 35 hours per week. One is permanent, and one is fixed term until November 2022.

The University of Westminster has been engaged in air transport research, consultancy and teaching for over 40 years. The air traffic management team is located within the School of Architecture and Cities, based at our Marylebone campus, in central London. Air traffic management has been a core area of research for over 20 years, with a very strong international reputation and with particular emphases on economics, operations, data analysis, modelling and performance. Following several successful H2020 project bids, we are now looking to expand this research area through the appointment of two Research Fellows.

The postholders will work on these new projects with the air traffic management team, led by Professor Andrew Cook. The position requires individual and collaborative research, contributions to research bids, co-authored publication work and activities to promote impact and extend the team’s research portfolio, with a high standard of written and spoken English.

The postholders will need to demonstrate skills and experience in data analysis, optimisation methods, and a range of machine learning algorithms and applications (such as predictive analytics and data mining/classification). Previous experience of analytical modelling and good numerical modelling skills (e.g. network simulation) must be demonstrated. (Knowledge of ensemble learning and of stochastic modelling would be an advantage.)

The position requires the ability to work efficiently with high volumes of data, with experience of data cleaning, data fusion, and data storage/management. (Knowledge of NoSQL databases and secure data frames would be an advantage).

Candidates from disciplines outside the field of transport will be considered. Work in our team often draws on complex network metrics and measures of causality. Experience of European air traffic management principles and flight trajectory optimisation would be an advantage. The former must otherwise be acquired, with team support, in post.

Shortlisted candidates will be contacted by e-mail by 30 July 2020 regarding interviews.

Due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation, interviews will be conducted remotely, on 12 August 2020. Shortlisted candidates will be required to make a short, technical presentation as part of their interview, on a topic to be notified on shortlisting. The interview technical arrangements will be agreed in advance with the candidate (probably Skype). The successful candidate would start ASAP thereafter.

It is likely that the initial period in post would be undertaken remotely, until such time as government guidance advises on the safety of the lifting of current restrictions. The ATM team uses remote tools extensively for its research collaborations in any case, such that issues are not foreseen with the postholders initially working remotely. No special tools are required.

To apply for this vacancy please click above. Further information can be found in the job description and person specification, which can be accessed through link below.

Closing date: midnight on 23 July 2020

Interviews are likely to be held on: 12 August 2020

Please note: We are unable to accept applications by email. All applications must be made online. CVs in isolation or incomplete application forms will not be accepted.

Who we are

At MADE.COM we believe that everyone should have access to great design. So, we’ve taken a unique approach to making and selling furniture - no middlemen, no agents or importers and no high street stores. Instead we work directly with designers and manufacturers so we can offer high-end furniture at attractive prices.

It’s not an easy task – it takes a creative and dedicated team to make it happen where everyone has an important part to play. We combine our individual passions and skills to create innovative work that’s as exciting and unconventional as the business itself. It’s a place where all ideas are listened to, where brainstorming means job titles get left at the door and where a self-starter can really make their mark.

What you’ll be doing

We are looking for someone who can take and drive the data science capability of the Analytics team. As our Lead Data Scientist, you will be mentoring a team of data scientists and analysts who will be participating in different projects within cross-functional teams.

Technology and innovation are two key factors in our success. Our platform allows us to manufacture in any of over 150 locations, and ship multiple items from one basket seamlessly. Our backend system keeps track of every item of stock, whether it’s in production, on a boat, or at a delivery hub. This allows us to eliminate dormant stock and produce big ticket items as close to on-demand as possible, allowing us to make over 1500 new products this year alone. As a company we seek a competitive edge; as technologists and craftsmen we’re no different. We’ve embraced event-driven architectures, DDD, and CQRS in order to achieve our technical goals. We’re trail-blazers in the Python community, and we contribute back by writing and talking about our findings and open-sourcing our tools.

Analytics team supports multiple streams of the business with some exceptionally successful projects from stock ordering forecasting and optimisation to marketing bidding engine optimisation. And we plan to continue investment into areas that activate the value of DATA. We currently use Google Cloud tools primarily for our internal Data Platform such as BigQuery and Cloud Composer. All our code is executed in the Cloud through DAGs which allows the team to build highly scalable data pipelines and deliver business value efficiently.

Initial areas of responsibility will include:

Data Science

This is a UK remote position

Who we are

The current system of credit, based on bureau data, is deeply unfair, penalising people who live in lower income areas, people who are new to the country or customers who have used high risk products in the past (such as payday loans). Koyo was founded in 2018, on the principle that everyone should have access to affordable credit regardless of where they are from, where they live, or types of credit that have used.

Many seeking credit are charged excessive fees and interest rates for borrowing that cause financial problems, rather than solve them. We’re changing all that.

Koyo uses innovative technology to offer fairly priced credit to millions of UK customers. We’re based in London, with global ambitions. Koyo is backed by leading venture capital funds (the same funds that backed the likes of Revolut, Transferwise and others) and some of the most reputable angel investors in the UK. Join us, and help put an end to predatory financial firms and be part of an exciting and rewarding journey.

Our story so far

In 2016, Thomas, the founder of Koyo moved to the UK and found accessing credit to be difficult if not impossible. This is because his credit history did not follow him from his home country. He realised that having an imperfect credit history affects millions of people who are new to the country, but also people who have failed to build a credit history in the UK more generally. In September 2018 we raised our first round of venture funding and have since raised further debt and equity funding from venture capital funds and private investors.

What you'll be doing

You will be our first dedicated data scientist hire.
Improve the accuracy of our in-house banking transaction classification engine - researching, evaluating and recommending the best machine learning algorithms.
Analyse the banking transaction data providing insights and recommendations for summary statistics and quality measures.
Analyse and make recommendations for policies that maximise loan approval rates whilst keeping loan defaults within target using and cross-referencing across all data-sets that are available to us (including but not limited to self-stated application data, credit reference agency block-summary and detailed data and bank transaction data).
Working across the wider team, providing proactive and reactive reporting and analysis.
Longer term, you will help build out the data scientist function at Koyo.
Requirements

Strong commercial experience, likely to have a computer science or related degree
Entrepreneurial and excited about working at an early stage startup
Knowledge of multiple machine learning algorithms - when to use them, when not to and how to optimise

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Reinforcement Learning based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

"Senior Data Scientist, Operations",£69K-£124K (Glassdoor Est.),"We're looking for a curious, adaptable Data Scientist to join the Data & Customer Operations teams at Monzo!

You'll have the chance to analyse all aspects of our customer support operations and help the teams scale how we work to support millions of customers.

We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company. And we're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business. All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of everyday data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker, which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.

The Data & Customer Operations teams


The data team's mission is to

Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

This mission encompasses three major areas of work: (1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus. We work in cross-functional squads, so every data scientist is a member of the central data team as well as fully embedded into an area such as operations or product squads.

For this role, we are looking for a Data Scientist/Analyst who will focus on customer operations analytics. You’ll be working at the intersection of the Data & Customer Operations teams.

The Customer Operations team looks after the tasks within Monzo that scale with customers. They're a crucial link between Monzo and our customers. Customer Operations spans multiple product squads, a planning team, an incubator team and almost 1,000 passionate COps (that’s what we call our agents). All of these teams work to make sure we can support Monzo's explosive growth through running a variety of optimization projects for Customer Operations.

The role


The Customer Operations team are solving some of the most exciting problems in Monzo. There are lots of unsolved, hard problems where data plays a key part but you will also need to think deeply about people, product and process when solving these problems.

A few examples of questions and challenges:
How do we balance (i) providing an amazing customer experience (ii) cultivating a positive and motivating culture for our customer support agents and (iii) being the most efficient and flexible operations team in the industry.
How can we automate our processes in a way that will allow us to scale to 1 billion customers and thousands of COps?
How can we measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week? What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful?
What are our customers contacting us about & when/how can we automate the answer to their question? (partnering with the machine learning and software engineering teams)
How can we drive efficiency by 20% for our customer operations? What is the best way to measure efficiency?
What sets the most effective COps (the lovely customer support people who chat to our customers) apart?
What is a good customer experience? How can we measure this? How can we optimise for this?
You will help us make data-driven decisions and shape the direction of this exciting and evolving part of the Monzo business. We’re looking for someone who cares deeply about understanding our business and customers, who can communicate their findings clearly to business partners and can drive actions on top of insights.

What’s special about data at Monzo?


Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. If you want to train a Machine Learning model faster, just spin up a compute engine instances and submit a job from your local machine, no DevOps skills required.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there’s some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

You should apply if:


What we’re doing here at Monzo excites you!
You want to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and your colleagues
You pro-actively identify issues, and enjoy tackling them and coming up with solutions
You’re comfortable getting hands-on and taking a step back to think strategically
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You are happiest exploring data, making discoveries and understanding their implications
You can manage multiple stakeholders with competing priorities
Logistics


We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.

We offer share options and competitive salaries based on skills and experience, which could be anywhere between £49,000 - £80,000 per year.

We're usually always hiring for Data Scientist, so there's no closing date for this job.

Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a take home task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions.

Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, from home or as a job-share, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.

"Senior Data Scientist (Belfast, UK)",£25K-£34K (Glassdoor Est.),"What is Slice?

Slice is the leading technology and marketing platform made exclusively for local pizzerias, making it super easy to order delicious, authentic local pizza anywhere, anytime. We serve the $44 billion U.S. pizzeria market in two ways: by providing a pizza-centric mobile and web ordering experience for consumers, and by empowering local restaurants with the technology, tools, and marketing to grow their business, while helping them compete with Big Pizza. Can you imagine what a small mom and pop pizza shop could achieve with the resources of Domino's?

Slice was born in 2011 and has quietly bootstrapped its way to building a network of more than 10,000 pizzerias nationwide. Ilir Sela, our founder and CEO, started the company as a passion project to help his friends and family in the pizza business, but he quickly saw a massive opportunity to champion these small businesses by bringing their bites to the masses. Ilir has since built an amazing team of operators, marketers, technologists, and investors — all dedicated to making it easier for people to enjoy their favourite local pizza.

What you'll do.

Leverage your quantitative expertise to understand how Slice can apply supply and demand levers to unlock marketplace opportunities; techniques will include experiment design, predictive modelling, observational analysis, pattern recognition and any others as needed
Partner with Product and Marketing teams to set clear goals, measure progress against them and influence their respective roadmaps
Ensure consistent tracking, analysis, and reporting of core product and marketing programs and channel KPIs in weekly dashboards
Build and maintain executive dashboards in Looker
Improve the accessibility and organisation of data
Collaborate with Data Engineering to understand all data flows, build new flows as needed and create appropriate data dictionaries for business users
Simplify complex raw data into user friendly explores, looks, and dashboards for audiences across the organization
Perform complex ad-hoc data and analysis requests

What we're looking for:
BSc in a quantitative discipline (MSc preferred)
4+ years of specialised experience in Data Science or Advanced Analytics solving complex analytical problems in a technology environment

Excellent verbal and written communication skills
Strong communication skills
Able to clearly express opinions on product design, while respecting the thoughts and opinions of their peers.
Proven ability to communicate and collaborate effectively with engineers and non-engineering stakeholders alike

Interested?

We operate like a startup, so being self-motivated, curious, and flexible is a good start. You prefer to come up with your own solutions to problems but are not afraid to ask for help. You enjoy making suggestions for how to improve our product and business, no matter the department. You're the kind of person who roots for the underdog. And lastly, this job will probably be a lot easier if you have a soulmate-level love for authentic pizza.

Why Slice?

Join a community of best-in-class engineers who combine creativity, curious minds and a commitment to excellence with the desire and commitment to grow and build on the engineering skill base and community here in NI.

In several functions across the business, we’re reliant on tools that include some sort of machine learning component.

…and some other key skills & experience you’ll ideally have
Experience working in marketplace ecommerce businesses
Implementation of cloud-based ML solutions

The team spirit at NOTHS House is legendary, and while we all miss the in-office massages, hair cuts and the abundance of free fruit, we’ve taken to our virtual world with gusto and bring the team together regularly for socials and of course the odd Zoom quiz!

We endeavour to support our people to make sure work….well, works for them. And the pretty big issue of the recent global pandemic has propelled us into working more flexibly than ever before. With the office closed until at least September, we’re using the lessons learnt over this period to evolve our approach to flexible working whilst ensuring we all still get together as one #teamnoths

The Respiratory and Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Reference Unit (RVPBRU) is one of three Units within the Bacteriology Reference Department (BRD) on the Colindale site of Public Health England’s National Infection Service (NIS). BRD is a national and international reference department for a wide range of bacterial infections. We receive clinical samples and bacterial isolates from public health departments, National Health Service and commercial laboratories across the UK and internationally for specialist testing, bacterial characterisation and susceptibility testing.

RVPBRU provides references services forStreptococcus pneumoniae,Bordetella pertussis,Corynebacterium diphtheriae,Haemophilus influenzae,Legionella pneumophila, respiratoryMycoplasma, chlamydiae and other streptococci. It is the National Reference Laboratory for many of these organisms and is also the WHO Global Collaborating Centre for Diphtheria & Streptococcal infections and a WHO Collaborating Centre forHaemophilusinfluenzaeandStreptococcus pneumoniae. The RVPBRU comprises two sections, the Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Section (VPBS) and the Respiratory and Systemic Bacteria Section (RSBS). This post is within the Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Section.

We are looking for applicants for a fixed-term contract to work on a grant funded project to provide scientific laboratory support to a project designed to 1) detect and analyse the nasopharyngeal carriage of the bacteriumStreptococcus pneumoniaein adults with pneumonia, and 2) diagnose adult pneumonia patients infected withS. pneumoniaeby detecting bacterial capsule polysaccharide antigen in their urine. TheS. pneumoniaespecies can be subdivided into 100 serotypes according to structural variants of its capsule polysaccharide. This polysaccharide is used in the current vaccines againstS. pneumoniaedisease and so it is important to know the distribution of serotypes in both nasopharyngeal carriage and systemic disease.

Carriage ofS. pneumoniaewill be detected by culturing the bacteria from nasopharyngeal swabs and then characterised using a combination of traditional serotyping and bioinformatic analysis of whole genome sequencing data. In parallel, multiplex real-time PCR methodology will also be used to try and detect the carriage of multiple serotypes ofS. pneumoniaein both nasopharyngeal swabs and oral fluid (saliva) by targeting the genes involved in polysaccharide production.

S. pneumoniaeinfections will be diagnosed in patients using a Bioplex antibody assay that detects capsular polysaccharide in urine. This assay has been developed in our laboratory and can target multiple serotypes ofS. pneumoniaein parallel. The results of this testing will contribute to a long running project monitoring changes inS. pneumoniaeserotypes causing disease in adults in England.

Salary: £31,305 - £34,028 (Band D) or £38,969 - £43,300 (Band E) per annum dependent on skills and experience
Grade: D/E
Contract Type: Fixed Term (18 months)

Closing Date: 2nd August 2020

The ISIS pulsed neutron source at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory in Harwell is one of the world-leading facilities that uses neutrons to study materials at the atomic level across various disciplines in chemistry, physics, biology, geology and material sciences, as well as in the engineering and pharmaceutical industries. The Crystallography Group at ISIS contributes to the international success of ISIS by operating 9 neutron instruments for diffraction and imaging studies.

SXD is the only instrument dedicated to single crystal diffraction, which is recognised as the ‘gold standard’ technique for structural characterisation. SXD works in time-of-flight with polychromatic neutron beams, i.e. collecting large volumes of diffraction data at each crystal orientation. Unfortunately, the treatment of the diffraction data from a pulsed source, and in particular the wavelength-dependent corrections for extinction and absorption effects, are much more complex than on monochromatic steady-source instruments. In this context, we are looking for a highly motivated and independent scientist to extend and develop the necessary software for correction and processing of single crystal neutron diffraction data, in order to provide even more accurate and detailed structural information and boost the scientific output of the SXD user community.

Your responsibilities will include:

At Band D:
Examining existing software and determining requirements for new/modified algorithms according to the needs in processing single crystal diffraction data from a pulsed source such as ISIS
Writing and coding individual algorithms according to specifications
Testing and correction of software programs
Developing user interfaces where necessary
Writing the required documentation to support the use of the new programs
Providing data analysis support for users of the SXD single crystal diffractometer at ISIS
Presention of work at national and international conferences and meetings.
At Band E:
Coordination of feasibility studies to design software solutions for the development of the analysis software with colleagues in the MANTID software team at ISIS, the Diamond Light Source and STFC’s Scientific Computing Department
Evaluation of existing software and implement new solutions according to the requirements of single crystal diffraction experiments
Liaison with external networks and facilities (e.g. the European Spallation Source) to ensure the widest use of the software
Pursuit of an independent research programme, linked to the activities of the ISIS Crystallography Group.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

Data Architect,£69K-£95K (Glassdoor Est.),"Valtech is more than just a digital agency. Whilst we’ve been transforming our clients’ businesses for over 25 years, we’ve also been working hard to offer transformative job opportunities for our colleagues across the world.

From graduates to seasoned professionals who are experts in their field, Valtech will always be recognised not just for the quality of work we deliver, but for all of the amazing people that make it happen.

We are 3000+ people in nearly 40 offices in 16 countries. We work with some of the world’s best known brands from travel to retail, connected experiences to automotive and we don’t just talk about how to get things done, we really transform by doing.

Our Values

There are some fundamental principles to the way that we deliver.

Cross-functional teams: Agile methods have always emphasised the merit of teams with all the skills necessary to delivery on user’s needs. To work effectively in a multi-disciplinary team it helps to be genuinely interested in the work of those in other roles. We value the flexibility to pick up slack across other areas of capability as well as expertise and specialization.

Collaboration: We find that diverse groups working together come to better solutions. In user testing this approach builds empathy in the team. In design we collaborate to test ideas and develop alternatives. As a team we work together to improve our approach.

Continuous learning: This applies to product development as it applies to individuals. Our projects are designed to engage with uncertainty creating opportunities to learn. We use experiments, prototypes and hypotheses to learn about user behaviour, design algorithms and select technologies. Our communities of practice provide a space for us to improve and learn from peers. While as individuals a personal training budget enables opportunity to grow and develop.

Outcome Focus: When driving our projects we focus on outcomes. Knowing how a project will be deemed a success by users and customers enables creativity and innovation.

The Role

You’ll take overall responsibility on behalf of Valtech for the design and quality of data-centric solutions delivered to our customers. Our architects are involved in the detail, and you can expect to work closely with the engineering team. You’re also likely to become a ‘go-to’ authority within the company when it comes to data solutions, keeping up to date with industry developments and using your experience to assess the risk profiles of new projects.

You will have a broad responsibility for coordinating, leading and delivering solutions, this will include -
Architectural design for new systems, primarily focused on data flow pipelines, storage and analytics.
Analysis of business problems to understand system requirements, including quality attributes such as performance, availability and security.
Undertaking information assurance where required.
Engagement of technical and non-technical customer stakeholders at various levels in the organisation, advising and managing expectations where required.
Technology evaluation / assessment; identifying & recommending platforms and services.
Technical leadership of engineering teams, including mentoring where needed.
Representing the company in public forums.
Be instrumental in helping to build an Architecture function and work alongside a strong team of Data Scientists, Analysts and Data Engineers.
About you

You’ll have several years of experience, having gone through the full project lifecycle on numerous occasions; you’ve seen how design decisions play out in production. You may have worked in traditional data warehousing environments, but you are up to speed with more contemporary data architectures based on open source technologies.

You will have the following skills and experience -
Strong written, diagrammatic and spoken communication; ability to present to senior stakeholders.
Experience with varied types of data: tabular, connected, time-series, geospatial, image, etc.
Practical knowledge of:
Different types of database – relational; document; graph; columnar; key-value.
Large scale data processing platforms, typically based on Hadoop / Spark
Business intelligence / analytics products or frameworks
Data visualisation frameworks
Data analysis and data modelling requirements
Experience working with cloud platforms and working with relevant PaaS / SaaS offerings.

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Director of Applied Data Science - Financial Services based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Slice is the leading technology and marketing platform made exclusively for local pizzerias, making it super easy to order delicious, authentic local pizza anywhere, anytime. We serve the $44 billion U.S. pizzeria market in two ways: by providing a pizza-centric mobile and web ordering experience for consumers, and by empowering local restaurants with the technology, tools, and marketing to grow their business, while helping them compete with Big Pizza. Can you imagine what a small mom and pop pizza shop could achieve with the resources of Domino’s?

Slice was born in 2011 and has quietly bootstrapped its way to building a network of more than 10,000 pizzerias nationwide. Ilir Sela, our founder and CEO, started the company as a passion project to help his friends and family in the pizza business, but he quickly saw a massive opportunity to champion these small businesses by bringing their bites to the masses. Ilir has since built an amazing team of operators, marketers, technologists, and investors — all dedicated to making it easier for people to enjoy their favourite local pizza.

What you’ll do.
Leverage your quantitative expertise to understand how Slice can apply supply and demand levers to unlock marketplace opportunities; techniques will include experiment design, predictive modelling, observational analysis, pattern recognition and any others as needed

Serving government, business and citizens across Britain and the world, OS helps customers in virtually all sectors improve quality of life and we’re looking for people to join our journey…

Senior Data Scientist (PSGA Technical Support)

As a country and globally, we’re all experiencing challenging times right now, but Ordnance Survey (OS) continue to support the nation with our accurate geospatial data and services. As an organisation we are embarking on an ambitious growth strategy in location data, insight and services. Innovating our products, services and technology to benefit our customers, businesses and people across Great Britain and globally. In order to do this, we want to continue adding new skills and capabilities to our business and even in these tough times, we’re able to use technology to recruit talent to OS.

About Us

Ordnance Survey Limited (OS) is the national mapping agency for Great Britain, and a world-leading geospatial data and technology organisation. As a reliable partner to government, business and citizens across Britain and the world, OS helps its customers in virtually all sectors improve quality of life. OS expertise and data supports efficient public services and infrastructure, new technologies in transport and communications, national security and emergency services and exploring the great outdoors.

Imagine working for an organisation which has been innovating and pushing boundaries for over two centuries – and continues to do so today. A company full of unique expertise and skill, with a host of exciting and innovative opportunities to pursue. A business which is making a real difference to lives, communities and businesses everywhere. Ordnance Survey provides world-renowned data and services which underpin critical activities across government and the commercial sector, while continually expanding its horizons both internationally and into the future.

About the Role

This is an opportunity for a Senior Data Scientist to oversee our PSGA Technical Support activities within our Data Science & Analytics team at Ordnance Survey - to provide expert geospatial data science support to government combined with leadership across a variety of data science projects.

In this role, you will use your skills and experience to provide expert geospatial data science support to government, working closely with government data scientists, analysts, statisticians and others to solve geospatial problems across the whole public sector – from the centre of government in Whitehall to individual Local Authorities. For this role, you must be willing and able to travel regularly, especially to and from London, to meet face-to-face* with external customers. You may also be required to undertake longer-term secondments into other parts of government: Ordnance Survey is looking to support government policy-making by embedding geospatial data experts directly into government projects, and you must be willing to be part of this (alongside other members of your team). You will also be required to undergo Developed Vetting (DV) security clearance, if you have not done so already, to ensure that you are able to support any projects that may arise in future – regardless of sensitivity.
note that face-to-face meetings and travel will not be required during the current Covid-19 epidemic; during this extraordinary period, only remote/online customer meetings will be taking place.
You will be highly customer focused, always considering the customer business problem in everything you do and working as closely with customers as possible at every stage. You will provide expert advice to customers and stakeholders in applying geospatial analysis, data-mining techniques and data modelling to optimise decisions within government, and will provide thought-leadership, consultancy and technical expertise to government customers in geospatial data analytics and implementation.

You will also be a natural innovator – always seeking to try out new ideas, and you will regularly undertake rapid proof of concept work for new and innovative propositions involving data. We’ll be looking to our senior data scientists as a rich source of new ideas and inventions – some of which will grow to become new products or services from Ordnance Survey into government.

Finally, you will manage a team of highly motivated, highly skilled and similarly minded geospatial data scientists and will work with them to meet Ordnance Survey’s customer support commitments to government (at levels 3 and 4 as set out within the Public Sector Geospatial Agreement), as well as representing Ordnance Survey’s data science capabilities through meetings, presentations and project work with government customers.

You will lead in a new clinical research study on the management of the clinical and research data of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) and other early-stage B cell malignancies, working with data specialists in the Clinical Informatics Research unit and with an expanding team of clinicians and scientists with a strong grounding in cancer B-cell immunology, genomics, molecular/cellular biology and bioinformatics at the School of Cancer Sciences. You will use an Electronic Case Report Form ALEAS and the BC Platforms data warehouse incorporating medical records and high-dimensional biomedical data, as well as applying the latest trans-disciplinary data analysis techniques to refine phenotypic, genetic and functional marker to improve clinical decision-making. You will ensure the collection and validation of clinical and biological data flowing from recruiting sites into your platforms. You will coordinate the study by interacting directly with local ECRIN-M3 team members, research assistants and nurses, and with international collaborators, including those from Spain and Italy involved in the programme.

You will be an enthusiastic and well-motivated investigator capable of developing your research project as well as a good team-player with excellent communication skills, working in a fertilising environment of clinicians and scientists with a strong grounding in cancer B-cell immunology, genomics, molecular/cellular biology and bioinformatics. You will design new models of disease progression from the very early stages (early cancer) to overt B-cell leukaemias and lymphomas. You will be expected to contribute to the development and enhancement of the B-cell group within the School of Cancer Sciences, nationally and internationally.

The successful candidate will have a PhD degree or equivalent EU qualification and experience, with deep knowledge of medical statistics. Knowledge on prognostic scores in mature B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and indolent B-cell lymphomas are desirable. Applications from EU and international candidates are welcome.

This post will be based within the Cancer Research UK Centre and Centre for Cancer Immunology at the Southampton General Hospital campus, occupying modern, well-equipped, purpose-built laboratories, with support from clinical and laboratory-based colleagues.

“Alexa find me a job on the Alexa Knowledge team!”

Our focus in the Alexa Knowledge group combines natural language understanding, acquiring large volumes of structured knowledge, and building autonomous machine reasoning to allow our customers to get answers to their questions in the most natural way possible. We are part of a huge research and engineering effort on the Amazon Alexa organisation.

We have solved many complex problems to get to where we are today, but there are still plenty of challenges ahead of us, and Alexa is getting smarter every day. The problems we solve in the Alexa Knowledge group in Cambridge help Alexa get smarter by understanding the different ways people talk, by learning more and more facts about the world, by improving her common sense reasoning and by responding in the most natural way possible in multiple languages. We set out to build Alexa at Amazon because we believe that voice will fundamentally improve the way people will interact with technology, and we wanted to create a computer that could be controlled entirely by your voice.

In the Knowledge Extraction and Understanding team, we are constantly making Alexa smarter by enabling her to learn about what is happening in the world. We use multiple Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to enable learning and reasoning across a range of unstructured data sources, at internet-level scale. This requires methods that lie beyond the cutting edge academic and industrial research of today. The scope of this role is broad, covering a diverse range of problem space that include, but are not limited to fact extraction from unstructured text, large-scale categorisation, supervised, weakly supervised or self-supervised learning methods etc.

As an applied scientist, you will bring academic and/or industrial practical experience of solving hard problems through developing state of the art research methods. You will have the opportunity to guide junior scientists, and others interested in research. You will also have the opportunity to learn from some of the best researchers in the field, and be challenged by the engineering discipline needed to enable Alexa to operate at a global scale.

To do this, we're looking for an inspiring Data Science leader ready to lead and grow our Data Science team, cultivating an environment of experimentation and learning.

Companies can leverage data science in a number of ways, and we think the role of a Data Scientist falls into three distinct categories:

1) You work for a business function analysing & reporting on how to improve a key metric, e.g increasing user conversion
2) You are responsible for writing production models to enhance the main product, e.g recommendation systems for e-commerce
3) You build the product - without machine learning, it wouldn't exist

The Data Science team build the product at Tessian. We couldn't exist without our machine learning models; it’s at the heart of what we do, and it’s what our clients rely on day-to-day. We're searching for a leader who is excited about the opportunities and challenges that come with researching, building and deploying real-time production models.

We’re looking for applicants with previous experience managing applied Data Science teams at companies where machine learning and data science are critical to the company’s products. More junior than this? Check out our non-senior role variant here.

This is an advertisement for a permanent full-time Band 5 HCPC Registered Biomedical Scientist in Cellular Pathology. **Without HCPC Salary will be restriced to Band 3

The Cellular Pathology Department at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust currently deals with approximately 35,000 – 40,000 Histology specimens each year from across the county including St Richards Hospital, Chichester, Worthing Hospital and Southlands Hospital, Shoreham.

The bulk of the work is undertaken in Chichester and the successful candidate would be working within the main Histopathology Laboratory, which includes Immunocytochemistry, Non-Gynae Cytology, Special Stains, IF Skins and OSNA. We are continually updating our ICC (Leica Bonds) repertoire and hoping to further expand our Non-Gynae Cytology service. (Mortuary Services are also included within Cellular Pathology, but are not included within this role.)

This is an exciting time to join this growing department, which has undergone a considerable equipment refresh over the last 5 years, including the introduction of the Cerebro tracking system, new Peloris tissue processors and a new HistoCore Spectra stainer/coverslipper - with more items in the pipeline. We are currently awaiting confirmation of UKAS ISO15189 Accreditation.

The successful candidate will be working alongside other BMS's, AP’s, MLA’s and reporting to the Cellular Pathology Head Biomedical Scientist. Whilst the work will be undertaken mainly at St Richards Hospital, Chichester, there will also be a requirement to work sometimes at Worthing Hospital too, as per the departmental rota system. The main area of work for this individual will be within routine Histology (including ICC & Special Stains), however there is also a requirement for at least a basic working knowledge of Non-Gynae Cytology sample preparation.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms.

The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

Slice is the leading technology and marketing platform made exclusively for local pizzerias, making it super easy to order delicious, authentic local pizza anywhere, anytime. We serve the $44 billion U.S. pizzeria market in two ways: by providing a pizza-centric mobile and web ordering experience for consumers, and by empowering local restaurants with the technology, tools, and marketing to grow their business, while helping them compete with Big Pizza. Can you imagine what a small mom and pop pizza shop could achieve with the resources of Domino's?

Slice was born in 2011 and has quietly bootstrapped its way to building a network of more than 10,000 pizzerias nationwide. Ilir Sela, our founder and CEO, started the company as a passion project to help his friends and family in the pizza business, but he quickly saw a massive opportunity to champion these small businesses by bringing their bites to the masses. Ilir has since built an amazing team of operators, marketers, technologists, and investors — all dedicated to making it easier for people to enjoy their favourite local pizza.

What you'll do.
Leverage your quantitative expertise to understand how Slice can apply supply and demand levers to unlock marketplace opportunities; techniques will include experiment design, predictive modelling, observational analysis, pattern recognition and any others as needed
Partner with Product and Marketing teams to set clear goals, measure progress against them and influence their respective roadmaps
Ensure consistent tracking, analysis, and reporting of core product and marketing programs and channel KPIs in weekly dashboards

Collaborate with Data Engineering to understand all data flows, build new flows as needed and create appropriate data dictionaries for business users
Simplify complex raw data into user friendly explores, looks, and dashboards for audiences across the organization

BSc in a quantitative discipline (MSc preferred)

Able to clearly express opinions on product design, while respecting the thoughts and opinions of their peers.
Proven ability to communicate and collaborate effectively with engineers and non-engineering stakeholders alike

You enjoy making suggestions for how to improve our product and business, no matter the department. You're the kind of person who roots for the underdog. And lastly, this job will probably be a lot easier if you have a soulmate-level love for authentic pizza.

Why Slice?

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Science - Deep Learning Research based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are seeking a Data Manager to join the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) to provide project and data management for the Pan-Prostate Cancer Group of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC PPCG). This is an exciting role that requires an understanding of the EGA core mission and an enthusiasm for interacting with external collaborators to enhance and grow the EGA in line with the FAIR principles.

The EGA is a resource for permanent secure archiving and sharing of all types of potentially identifiable genetic and phenotypic data resulting from biomedical research projects. Its aim is to provide access to data, to foster data re-use, to enable reproducibility, and to speed up biomedical and translational research in line with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. As a part of the EGA team working with the PPCG, you will be responsible for managing data flow within EGA and among external resources as well as ensuring PPCG project milestones and deliverables are met.

The ICGC PPCG is an international collaboration performing the synchronized analysis of over 2000 prostate genomes and exomes, including re-analysis of deep sequencing of tumour-normal pairs as well as realignment and variant calling using dockerized pipelines. These genomic data are linked to rich clinical annotation and a globally standardized pathology analysis of each sample. Supported by regular in-person meetings, this tri-continental consortium works through regular steering committee and working-group calls. To support these analyses, we are seeking a Data Manager to join the EGA team to harmonise analyses and reporting across member organisations of the PPCG, and to serve as a project coordinator for the PPCG Technical Working Group which is responsible for primary data analysis.

Your role
A key function of the Data Manager role will be to manage data flow from multiple data providers to archival and analysis resources, including the EGA. Data management responsibilities include ensuring data and metadata adhere to standards; tracking PPCG data processing, archival, and availability; and working with EGA Helpdesk to support submission of and access to EGA data for approved users. The EGA team follows agile methodologies to track work using a mix of the RT ticketing system, JIRA, and Confluence in a collaborative environment.

The successful candidate will be the key individual coordinating the EGA’s involvement in the ICGC PPCG and will provide general PPCG project management support. Project management responsibilities include ensuring work for deliverables is scheduled, drafting deliverables such as regular reports and data archival progress updates, and representing the EGA at consortium meetings.

Because this is a highly dynamic role in terms of day-to-day responsibilities and interacting with PPCG group members, the successful candidate must be capable of working independently and in an international, collaborative, high-pressure environment. They will be required to follow standard operating procedures, work methodically, and understand the importance of privacy and security with respect to human data. An ability to work to tight deadlines independently and under pressure is essential. To view a copy of the full job description and responsibilities please click here.

Research Associate (Post-doctoral scientist) - Systems Cancer Pathology (Fixed Term),£38K-£75K (Glassdoor Est.),"Multidimensional tissue imaging to define tumour immune microenvironment state transitions during breast cancer progression

We are seeking a motivated post-doctoral scientist to join the newly established Systems Cancer Pathology group at the CRUK Cambridge Institute headed by academic pathologist Dr Raza Ali. Understanding how tumours coevolve with the tissue microenvironment (TME) is a pre-requisite for the effective use of immunotherapy, and may determine which pre-cursor lesions progress and which do not.

The successful candidate will lead the analysis of a unique multidimensional tissue imaging (imaging mass cytometry) dataset to investigate emergent features of the TME as it transitions from normality through pre-cursor in situ disease to established invasive breast cancer. We have assembled a unique resource coupling meticulous paired tissue sampling of precursor and invasive disease for multidimensional imaging to multiplatform genomic data across thousands of samples from over two hundred patients. Quantification of up to fifty proteins at subcellular spatial resolution will enable in-depth mapping of key cell phenotypes, their interactions and relational features ('micro-niches') that define TME dynamics through disease progression. Having precisely defined TME states, we will use genomic data to ask how these changes are determined by driver alterations and whether they exert a reciprocal effect on tumour evolution. This work will characterise TME transitions during cancer progression with unparalleled depth. It has the potential to identify the tissue phenotypes that define tumour evolution and determine the probability of disease progression.

This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to join a newly established lab working in one of the most exciting areas of cancer research within a leading institute. Frequent interactions with scientists from a range of disciplines (pathologists, oncologists, genomics, multiplexed imaging, astronomy etc.) will be essential for the success of this work. The role will provide extensive experience of deploying imaging mass cytometry (already successfully deployed within the institute) with quantitative analysis to answer questions with biological and clinical relevance. There will be ample opportunity for methods development and pursuit of independent research arcs. The role is best suited to candidates with training in computational biology, however outstanding individuals with some experience of computational biology but lacking formal training are also encouraged to apply. Candidates will have completed or be near completing a doctorate in a relevant quantitative discipline, computational biology or pure biology with a quantitative element. Scientists with a passion for high dimensional single cell analysis of human tissues will flourish in this role.

Fixed-term: The funds for this post are available for 3 years in the first instance.

Once an offer of employment has been accepted, the successful candidate will be required to undergo a basic disclosure (criminal records check) check and a security check.

On 1st October 2019, Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was created, through the merger of Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust. The newly formed Trust is responsible for managing services at Aintree University Hospital, Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool Dental Hospital and the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.

Bringing together a combined workforce of over 12,000 staff, the Trust has become the largest NHS employer in Merseyside and Cheshire. As well as providing general hospital services to the local population, the Trust provides a range of highly specialist services to more than two million people in the North West and beyond.

This merger has been driven by clinicians, who for a long time have recognised that a union of the Trusts will enable significant changes that will transform the way healthcare is delivered. The aim is to address the current levels of variation and fragmentation that exists between acute hospital services in Liverpool, and to ensure that all services are of the highest quality. The new Trust will also seek to influence the wider determinants of health by closer involvement in employment, housing and education, and to be part of a first class research and scientific development partnership with Higher Education and business enterprise across the city and beyond.

These changes, which will take place over the next few years, through a phased approach, building on the skills and talents of a fantastic workforce, to spread best practice, deliver innovation and provide sustainable services for patients. This will be achieved by reconfiguring services, centralised where necessary, local where possible and focusing on staff; with an ambition to be the best place for staff to train and work

We will soon be opening a new state of the art hospital. The new hospital will provide every patient with a single bedroom with en-suite facilities. We believe that modern healthcare is as much about privacy, comfort and dignity as it is about pioneering treatments and cutting-edge technology.

Product Manager - Data,£35K-£40K (Glassdoor Est.),"A note on remote working: Cazana has always embraced remote working. Due to COVID-19, we have doubled down on this, and as a result, this role can be a fully remote one. We are happy for you to work wherever suits you best, even if that is not our lovely shiny office. Post-COVID, you will be able to use the office if you would like, but you will only be required to do so if your manager has a good reason to get everyone together. We are now a fully distributed workforce and will be maintaining that approach even after the pandemic.

So, we're different. We’re different in that, our data is awesome. As a result, we sell our data as much as we sell our product, often through the building and deployment of APIs.

For this reason, we’re looking for a Data Product Manager. Someone who has the technical interest to work within this space, but who also carries some product management experience.
We know this isn’t a normal Product Manager role, but that’s what has us all excited.
You have worked as a Product Manager for a year or so. You may not be the most seasoned Product manager out there, but you are a doer. You get things done.
You are familiar with the full end to end cycle of product management, but where you are known is your knowledge and interest in the technical aspects of SaaS products. People know that you understand the technical stuff more than your average Product manager. Maybe you have a background in development and decided to switch over to the product. Nevertheless, as a result, you have an interest in working on the complex technical aspects of a product that is stronger than your peers.
You are curious, wanting to learn more, and you want to carve out a role for yourself that isn’t a usual Product Manager role.
However, you just don’t know how you can do that in your current role. Sure, you get more involved with the technical than other PMs, but you are still a Product Manager, and this leaves you restless.
Don’t be restless. Come and work with us.
About us and what you will be doing: We’re different. We’re using tech to seriously mess with a traditionally manual part of the automotive sector. We’re ambitious, and strongly backed, whilst still being masters of what we do.
Using big data and predictive analytics, Cazana analyses millions of automotive transactions daily. Its award-winning technology gives real-time access to the value and the risk associated with every vehicle on the road. The company is trusted by industry leaders such as dealerships, insurers, financial institutions, and manufacturers.
As our Data Product Manager, you will be a part of our Product team. However, you will be working super closely with our Data and Engineering teams. You will be tasked with owning the API product lifecycle. We sell APIs into numerous sectors, and in numerous forms, so wrapping your head around this, and working with the Chief Product Officer, and Senior Product Manager to improve the API proposition, as well as working with the Data and Engineering teams on their overall management of these products will be right where you live.

You will also be responsible for managing a few remote Data administrators, whose role with the business is bespoke data collection, as well as managing external clients and their data sources.

This will be quite the specialist role inside Cazana, and we’d love you to be able to bring with you some Product Management knowledge to bolster our team. We recognize that our team has done a fantastic job growing to date, but this role is quite a niche, and so we are looking for someone who can come on board, make the role their own, and add value from day 1. There will be learning on your part, but you will be needed to add value quickly, working on things autonomously whilst aligning with the wider product team. Your experience in Product is what will help you achieve this.

Salary offer: £45-£60k per annum (dependant upon experience)

You must have:
1-2 years experience in a Product Manager role
Knowledge and understanding of how APIs are built, deployed, used and measured as a product
Knowledge of Product Management models and methods, and experience of working within some of these
A passion for identifying, meeting and exceeding customer expectations and needs

You must be able to
Sit in a room with engineers and Data Scientists, and not be lost in the conversation.
Work with sales and customers to understand our customer needs, then translate them back to our engineers and scientists
Advocate for the Data team, helping other departments understand workloads and roadmaps so that the engineering team can work effectively
Navigate various databases including, but not limited to MySQL
Work quickly and to a high level of quality with autonomy

You will be part of our Department of Genetics led by Sr. Director, Joanna Howson PhD, which will consist of Specialists, Research Scientists, and Postdocs. The focus of this Department is to use data science and human genetics to identify new drug targets, through a range of approaches e.g. high-throughput genetic discovery screens; Mendelian Randomization; pLoF variant screens and precision medicine approaches relevant to type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cardiometabolic traits.

The position

We offer you an exciting position as a senior member of our Genetics department where you will have the opportunity to have an impact in a department which is currently developing rapidly both organisationally and scientifically.

In this position, you will work on state-of-the-art projects in human genetic-driven drug discovery for cardiometabolic diseases. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: initiating your own projects to identify novel drug targets and developing collaborations with academia and relevant businesses to aid this endeavour; acting as a scientific role model within the team to support more junior members in design, execution and interpretation of analysis; acting as a subject-matter expert and provide genetics expertise across the company.

In extension, you will have a broad range of collaborators, ranging from other statistical geneticists, computational biologists, to clinicians and external partners. You will also work closely with the leader of the department to introduce new methods, platforms and data sets.

We welcome candidates with a good team ethic, who pay close attention to detail, enjoy a fast paced, dynamic environment where creative intellectual independence is actively encouraged. Most importantly, you must be highly motivated by the opportunity to work with human genetics in the early stages of the drug discovery process. The successful candidate will be a key contributor in the group, and we are open to shaping the role to best fit your personal development and competencies in statistical genetics.

Qualifications
You have a PhD in a relevant field e.g. statistical genetics, genetic epidemiology or computational genetics and considerable relevant experience post PhD either in academia or a drug discovery setting. You are expected to have in-depth understanding of human genetic data e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and translating these findings.

Ideal candidates will also have experience of analysing and evaluating ‘omics data such as transcriptomics/proteomics/metabolomics and integration of these data to elucidate causal genes and pathways. A good understanding of statistical concepts, experience of manipulating and managing large datasets and strong computational skills including in statistical packages e.g. python, R, perl, bash would be highly desirable. A background in cardiometabolic trait research (e.g. T2D, renal, coronary artery disease, liver disease) would be an advantage.

You will be expected to work well both independently designing and driving the direction of projects, as well as collaboratively as part of a team alongside other inter-disciplinary colleagues in the project team and across NNRCO departments.

Background

ISIS is a world leading facility for research using neutron scattering and muon spectroscopy, with a strong scientific user program and extensive international links. It supports a national and international community of more than 3000 scientists for research into subjects ranging from fundamental physics and chemistry, through materials science to soft matter, biology and materials engineering.

The diverse fields of research necessitate a wide variety of data analysis software. There is an urgent need to modernise many of these software packages, and particularly to add distributed computing capabilities to them, in order to handle the ever-increasing data volumes collected from the ISIS instruments. The ISIS Scientific Software Group is forming a team of research software scientists/engineers for this purpose, with one position whose immediate focus is to improve two software packages for the analysis of magnetic neutron scattering data, SpinW and McPhase, in collaboration with the ISIS Excitations Group. Beyond this need, we envision that the work will expand in future into the development of new software to exploit advances in instrumentation.

The ISIS Scientific Software Group is responsible for ensuring that data reduction and data analysis facilities meets the needs of in-house and visiting scientists.

Post-Doctoral Research Scientist - Soil Carbon Specialist,£23K-£27K (Glassdoor Est.),"An opportunity exists to join the Strategic programme ‘Soils to Nutrition’ at Rothamsted Research which aims to understand nutrient cycling in arable and grassland systems at a range of scales. This post focuses on carbon cycling and seeks to employ a postdoctoral scientist with a thorough understanding of carbon cycling processes in soil and, ideally,someone who is highly skilled in using a suite of analytical and field techniques and advanced data analysis skills (e.g., using R, Matlab or similar).

The successful candidate will investigate several aspects related to soil structure including infiltration, compaction,aggregate stability and soil organic carbon at high spatial resolution in response to soil treatments and animal behaviour within fields. These measurements will be compared to detailed analysis of porosity and connected porosity determined from X-ray computed tomography of both soil columns and aggregates to determine the degree to which field-based measurements can act as proxies for detailed structural parameters.

At the field scale, the postdoc will, in addition to measuring C and its flow through the agricultural system, estimate budgets considering inputs/outputs and losses integrating existing data from the North Wyke Farm Platform and the recently established Long Scale Rotation Experiment in Harpenden. They will also identify gaps in the data and help develop protocols for new measurements and implement those.
